Getting Started
================

**Workspace**

For the construction of the Mozzie you will need a large well lit table about 1.5m wide and a power plug for soldering iron, hot glue and the optional heat gun.

**First Steps**



**Tools Required**

The most expensive tools required to build the Mozzie are a good soldering iron and a hot glue gun.
A hot air gun is optional to heatshrink the components like the quad arms, but it is recommended for a good finish.
A third hand to hold onto parts whilst soldering is also recommended.

Hand tool required:
 1) Hobby knife with replacement blades
 2) A good pair of sharp scissors
 3) A Philips and hex screw driver with the following sizes

Consumables Required:
 1) UHU Por (this glue is ideal for foam because it stays flexible and has a strong bond)
 2) A good quality clear packaging tape and a mesh reinforced tape
 3) Sandpaper

Recomended
 1) Soldering iron holder
 2) Hot Air Gun
 3) Cutting mat

 **Safety**

The two most dangerous things in building a Mozzie are cuts and burns.

Hobby knives and scissors are very sharp and should be handled with care, try not to use too much force when cutting and cut away from yourself.

The soldering iron and heat gun can cause serious burns that may require treatment by a doctor or hospital.
Use care to place the hot items on a non-flammable materials, out of the way so they can't be touched or bumped into. A soldering iron holder is recommended.
Soldering also produces toxic fumes so ensure that a well ventilated room and/or small extraction fan is used.
They can also present a fire danger so keep them away from flammable items and make sure they are turned off when you leave them.

Remember making the Mozzie should be fun, but getting hurt is not!
