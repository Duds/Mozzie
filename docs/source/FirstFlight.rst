First Flight
=============

CoG is on the main forward wing spars. Typically, I make it about 3mm nose heavy for good tail control.
Placing a smaller battery in the nose is fine, provided it can support the max quad/transition current draw (60-120A); laying the battery down might get the battery into the nose more to get the correct CoG.
Be careful not to unplug or damage the cables in the nose. Adding ballast (big washers, etc.) into the nose works as well, so long it's secured there and can't roll pass the battery. CoG is sensitive and, although it is identical for both winged and quad flight, it will easily take off in quad mode with the wrong CoG, but will result in a crash on          transition to forward flight. It's good practice to check the CoG every preflight check before each flight.

aka quadchute
Transitioning to qloiter from a forward flight mode is possible but not recommended.
Transition to qhover first then, 5-10seconds later, to qloiter, to avoid the aircraft using the quadmotors frantically trying to position hold whilst still moving forward.
Check the quad arms are secured/rigid on the fuselage prior to every flight. The quad arms can become loose after a rough landing.


Tuning
========

- Add most important tuning items and values in table.
- Use forward assist and wind feathering if operating as a quad in high winds.
- The forward motor does not have ESC prop braking activated. Landing on hard surfaces might cause a spinning forward motor to strike the ground on landing, which can damage the prop. (the aeronaut prop has fragile tips, which doesn't help)
