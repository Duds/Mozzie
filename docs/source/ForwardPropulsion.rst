Soldering
^^^^^^^^^^

First cut the three motor cables to about 250mm long, then remove about 4mm of cable insulation from each cable, tin the cable and three pole Male MT60 connector.
Slip the connector cover over the cables so that the clip tabs line up with the connector properly then solder the cables onto the male connector.
Remove about 4mm of insulation from the three black ESC cables, slip over the connector cover the right way, then tin the wire and female connector, and solder together.
Remove 4mm of insulation from the black and red ESC wires, tin both cables and two pole male XT 60 and solder together.

.. Tip::
  It's also possible to permanently solder the ESC and motor cables together and heat shrink the connection.
  To replace the motor or ESC it will have to be resoldered. When soldering larger connectors or wires it's sometimes necessary to increase the soldering iron temperature to get the solder to flow properly.

Assembly
^^^^^^^^^

Attach the provided metal motor bracket to the motor using the screws provided with thread lock.
Place the forward motor XT60 connector and ESC through the rear 3D printed motor mount center.

Carefully pull the ESC back towards the center of the airframe and guide the cable and motor until it is seated against the motor mount.
Be careful not to damage or bend the motor cables and make sure the MT 60 connectors are still fully connected inside the fuselage.

Rotate the motor so the cables go through the recess in the 3D print and then attach the motor to the 3D motor mount using 12mm self tapping screws, whilst making sure the motor cables are not pinched or damaged.

Orientate the ESC and attach to fuselage using some Velcro, cable clips or use the optional ESC Air scoop if required (which needs to be cut out of the foam in the right position, so the ESC can be placed in it)

Use self adhesive cable clips, cable ties and cable wrap to attach the cables in the correct position directly against the side of the fuselage, in such a way that the cables are not taught, caught or damaged.

Attach the two UBECs into the two nooks in the side of the fuselage with Velcro, as shown.

.. Tip::
  Using Velcro for installing components means that:
   - They can easily be attached and removed as required
   - The components can come apart should the aircraft crash, typically resulting in less damage
   - The components have some vibration isolation
