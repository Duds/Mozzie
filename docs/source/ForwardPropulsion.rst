Forward Propulsion
=====================

Place forward motor ESC into tail of fuselage and guide the three motor cables out of the rear 3D printed motor mount center.
Connect the three motor cables to the ESC making sure they are not loose and can come apart.

Carefully pull the ESC back towards the center of the airframe and guide the motor until it is seated against the motor mount.
Be careful not to damage or bend the motor cables.

Attach the motor to the motor mount using XX self tapping screws, whilst making sure the motor cables are not pinched or damaged.

Orientate the ESC and attach to fuselage using some Velcro, cable clips or ESC Air scoop (which needs to be cut out of the foam in the right position so the ESC can be placed in it)

Install the Mozzie Power Loom into the fuselage on the right hand side making sure the front ESC XT30 plugs are facing forwards (that's the two that are directly connected to the middle of the loom and fork at the XT30's)
Use self adhesive cable clips, cable ties and cable wrap to attach the cables in the correct position directly against side of the fuselage, in such a way that the cables are not taught, caught or damaged.

Attach the two UBECs into the two nooks in the side of the fuselage as shown with Velcro.

.. Tip::
  Using Velcro for installing components means that:
   - They can easily be attached and removed as required
   - The components can come apart should the aircraft crash typically resulting in less damage
   - The components have some vibration isolation
