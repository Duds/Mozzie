Propulsion
==========

The Mozzie propulsion system and component selection is a result of significant testing and optimization.
The configuration as per the parts list will allow the Mozzie to operate as per the specification,
however motor and propulsion setups will likely improve over time.

The most important items to check when operating the propulsion system, or configuring a new system are:
 * Make sure the ESC and motors are operating within the specified ranges, for Voltage, Current load and temperature
 * The biggest killer of motors and ESC's is over dimensioning the propellers beyond the capacity of the motors
 * Make sure the ESC settings meet the motor manufacture recommendations
 * ONLY connect the Power Module with current sensing between the power loom and forward motor ESC connectors

These setup and configuration pages are only for the recommended setup as per the parts list.
Please consult the component manufacturers manuals before operation.
