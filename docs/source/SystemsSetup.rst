Systems Setup
=============

Finish Build
------------

Set control surface and Loctite control horn screws!
Cut hole in foam lid for Borroca Tube!



  - Disable the airspeed in parameters if you want to fly without it.
  - With quad assist enabled I'd recommend disabling stall prevention for better flight control.
  - As discussed don't connect a current sensor between the battery and main cable loom unless this is rated for over 150A (which most are not). Rather connect this between the rear Xt60 and the forward motor ESC. Power is provided to the PXH/servo's via ubec so the current/power module is optional/redundant. Also the pi has a soldered power cable that can be connected to the PXH USB JST port for third power redundancy. Plug this in as required.


Comms Setup
------------

  Add Comms setup info like IP and Channels etc

.. Warning::
  Before doing any of the following tests remove all the propellers from the aircraft.
  Failure to do so can lead to serious injury that can require hospitalization. All propellers are dangerous, sharp and can easily cut to the bone if not handled carefully. Use Caution. Remove Props!



Pixhawk Setup
...............

AHRS Orientation, MP RC calibration, ACC Cal, Mag Cal/orientation, Bat Mon setup and V+A cal,



Control Surfaces Test
